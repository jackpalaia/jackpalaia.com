      <p>
        Here&apos;s my <a href="/resume">resume</a>. I&apos;m currently working at
        LinkedIn as a software engineer on the team that maintains Apache
        Zookeeper.

        When building software I try to get things done. I try to strike a
        balance between moving fast and breaking things, and building systems
        that will be able to be maintained for years to come. This comes with
        proper planning, well-implemented design processes, and clever
        engineering.
