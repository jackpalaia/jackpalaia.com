      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m currently finishing my BS in computer science at Georgia Tech. I
        will graduate in summer 2023, and after will be working at LinkedIn as a
        software engineer. My main professional interest lies in distributed
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I like to play tennis, golf, and poker. I also like to
        read and learn about random things, some of which include art history,
        world geography, and languages.
