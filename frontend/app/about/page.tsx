      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I grew up in Littleton, Massachusetts, which is a small town northwest
        of Boston. I got my BS from Georgia Tech in computer science in 2023,
        and since have been working full time at LinkedIn on the team that
        maintains Apache Zookeeper. My main professional interest lies in
        distributed systems, but I enjoy all different types of programming.

        Outside of work, I like to play tennis, golf, and occasionally poker. I
        also like to read and learn about random things, some of which include
        art history, world geography, and languages.
